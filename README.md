Click, Predict, Trust: Clinician-in-the-Loop AI Segmentation for CT-Based Prognosis within the Knowledge-to-Action Framework

**Project Overview**

This repository contains the implementation, experimental results, and supplemental materials for our study on deep learning (DL)-based lung cancer segmentation and prognostic modeling. The work evaluates multiple DL architectures within the Knowledge-to-Action (KTA) framework, focusing on geometric accuracy, radiomics reproducibility, and survival prediction across multi-center CT datasets.
